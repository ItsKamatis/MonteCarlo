# Portfolio Performance Monte Carlo Simulation

## Project Description
This repository hosts a Python script designed to perform a Monte Carlo simulation for forecasting portfolio performance over a specified time frame. The script utilizes historical stock data to simulate different portfolio outcomes and calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to assess potential financial risks.

## Features
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulates future portfolio values using historical return data to model potential outcomes over 120 days.
- **Risk Assessment**: Computes Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to measure and understand the potential risk within the investment portfolio.
- **Data Visualization**: Plots the simulation results to provide a visual representation of potential portfolio value changes over time.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, yfinance

## Installation
First, clone this repository to your local machine: 
- git clone https://github.com/ItsKamatis/MonteCarlo.git

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:
cd MonteCarlo
pip install pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance

## Usage
Run the script from the command line:
- python MCVAR.py

Make sure to adjust the stock symbols and the initial investment amount as needed in the script to fit your portfolio.
